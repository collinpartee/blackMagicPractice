These efforts resulted in armistice agreements between the new state of Israel and four of its Arab neighbours: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Two members of the Norwegian parliament nominated Ralph Bunche for the Nobel Peace Prize. Both had connections to the newly founded United Nations. One was Norway\'s first UN ambassador, and the other was a member of the Norwegian UN delegation. The nomination stated: "Although it can not be said to be Dr. Bunche\'s merit, but the development process itself that made the parties end the hostilities, there can be no doubt that it is Dr. Bunche\'s merit that the challenging negotiations over a ceasefire were brought to a positive result in a relatively short time". The nominators had several motives. Awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Bunche "would thereby not only honour him personally, but express trust and faith in the ability of the United Nations to solve international disputes by way of mediation between the parties". Furthermore, the nominators could not "neglect to mention that giving the Nobel Peace Prize to a member of the coloured race is a boost to peace in itself". Thus the Peace Prize was meant to strengthen the UN and to serve as an initiative against racism as well as to honour Ralph Bunche.'],

            longDescription: ["The circumstances surrounding the death of Emmett Till provide chilling insight into the racism that dominated the South in the 1950s. Till was a fourteen-year-old Chicago native visiting relatives in Mississippi. While out with his cousins and friends on the night of 24 August 1955, he allegedly accosted a white woman in the grocery store owned by her husband. Accounts vary as to what Till actually said or did. According to the woman Till grabbed her and made lewd remarks. Some witnesses claimed that he only whistled at her. Still others asserted that he made no advances at all, that he whistled habitually to control a speech defect.",
            "Roy Bryant considered his wife's honor tainted by the incident. Several nights after the episode, Bryant, his half brother J. W. Milam, and possibly other accomplices kidnapped Till from his relatives' home in the middle of the night. The two men beat him severely and, apparently enraged that he had a picture of a white woman in his wallet, shot Till and threw him in a nearby river. Several days later the body was found, and Bryant and Milam were charged with murder.",
            "Mississippi politicians and newspapers unanimously condemned the murderers and promised swift justice. However, Mississippians became more defensive as for weeks the press bombarded them with harsh condemnations of racial violence in the South. The highly publicized trial of the two men was charged with racial tension. African-American politicians and reporters from the North were treated contemptuously and were segregated in the courtroom. The prosecution was poorly prepared, and the substance of the defense was the astounding claim that Till was not actually dead. The badly decomposed body was identified only by Till's ring on its finger. The sheriff of Tallahatchee County, who investigated the case, speculated on the witness stand that an unnamed group of 'rabble-rousers' had planted the evidence. The all-male, all-white jury was apparently convinced: they acquitted Bryant and Milam after deliberating slightly longer than an hour. \n\n News of the verdict was received around the country and the world with astonishment. A survey of European reactions conducted by the American Jewish Committee reported that American prestige had been 'seriously damaged' by the outcome of the trial. The press in Mississippi, on the other hand, closed ranks and praised the fairness of the trial.",
            "The truth of what happened that night became public knowledge several months after the trial. William Bradford Huie, an Alabama journalist in Mississippi to report on the aftermath of the case, offered Bryant and Milam money to tell their story. Since the two could no longer be prosecuted for a crime of which they had already been acquitted, they gladly told for a fee of how they had beaten and killed young Till. Huie reported what the killers told him in the 24 January 1956 issue of Look magazine. Now publicly exposed as murderers, Bryant and Milam were ostracized by the community, and both moved elsewhere within a year. Emmett Till in death became a martyr for the civil rights movement, a symbol of the racial hatred African-Americans had yet to overcome."],

Of course, caddies get to play in their free time and by age 13, Sifford was frequently shooting par.\n\n Charles Sifford won the National Negro Open five times in a row (1952-1956), while repeatedly being denied a PGA card. He was finally invited to the tour in 1960, when the PGA dropped it’s “Caucasian Only” rule, under pressure from the California attorney general. \n\n Even though he was 39 when he joined the PGA, Sifford won two events–the 1967 Greater Hartford Open and the 1969 Los Angeles Open. He went on the become one of the original members of the Champions Tour in 1975. \n\n Sifford made history again in 2004 when he became the first African-American inductee in the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida. \n\n Two generations of African-American golfers are indebted to Mr. Sifford’s efforts. Tiger Woods was quoted at Mr. Sifford’s induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame as saying, “He has my respect and my gratitude for the sacrifices he made to open the doors to this great game to people of color.” ",

It was at this place that he was arrested by Lieut. Bennett, who had been sent by Arent S. De Peyster of the British Army to forestall an anticipated attack on Mackinac by George Rogers Clark. Point du Sable's arrest seems to have been due to his seeming attachment to the American cause, although at the time he was in the employ of a British trader named Durand, who had undertaken to guide a British war party to the Illinois country to co-operate with Bennett. In his petition for a grant of land from the United States Government, presented in 1783, Point du Sable satisfied the Commissioners that he was a citizen of the United States. He stated that as early as 1780 he had resided at Peoria with his family and had improved a farm of thirty acres between the Old Fort and the new »ettlements of Peoria. In 1790 he was again in Chicago and probably intermittently for five or six years. In this same year, on October 4, Susanne, the natural daughter of Point du Sable and an Indian woman, married Jean Baptiste Pelletier at Cahokia, and on October 7, 1799, a child born of this union was baptized in the Old Cathedral at St. Louis. The entry states that Pelletier's spouse, Susanne Point Sable, was 'Habit a Chicagou.' In 1796 he appeared at Mackinac. The next record of him is as a witness or juror on September 29, 1802, in the St. Clair County, Illinois (then Indiana Territory), Court of Common Pleas.",

As part of the Nation’s bicentennial, the week was expanded to a full month in 1976.

The Journal also published biographies of prominent African Americans and listings of births, deaths, and marriages in the African American community in New York. Freedom's Journal circulated in 11 states, the District of Columbia, Haiti, Europe, and Canada. Freedom's Journal had many articles on information such as world wide news, and many job listings, and announcements on housing, weddings, and funerals. This helped blacks become more aware of the world. \n\n The newspaper employed subscription agents such as David Walker, who in 1829 published the first of four articles that called for rebellion. The pamphlet 'Walker's Appeal' stated, '...it is no more harm for you to kill the man who is trying to kill you than it is for you to take a drink of water...'

He worked to preserve the history of African Americans and accumulated a collection of thousands of artifacts and publications. He noted that African American contributions 'were overlooked, ignored, and even suppressed by the writers of history textbooks and the teachers who use them.' Race prejudice, he concluded, 'is merely the logical result of tradition, the inevitable outcome of thorough instruction to the effect that the Negro has never contributed anything to the progress of mankind.'
